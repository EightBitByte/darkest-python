# About this project
For some time, I have been interested in creating a text-based adventure game, but I didn't want to rely on a clunky console or shell in order to display visuals and text.
Then, when I was introduced to Qt, I decided to give it a go, and this is my attempt in Python.

# Update 5/17/23
I will no longer be continuing this project, instead porting it to C++ and continuing from there. I may someday return and complete it.
